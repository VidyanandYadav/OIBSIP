## 📌 Internship Tasks  

### 🌸 Task 1: Iris Flower Classification  
- **Objective**: Build a model to classify iris flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica based on their measurements.  
- **Approach**:  
  - Loaded Iris dataset from Scikit-learn  
  - Performed EDA and visualizations  
  - Trained Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models  
  - Evaluated with accuracy score and confusion matrix  
- **Outcome**: Achieved high accuracy in predicting flower species.

### 📊 Task 2: Unemployment Rate Analysis  
- **Objective**: Analyze unemployment trends in India during the Covid-19 pandemic.  
- **Approach**:  
  - Collected and preprocessed unemployment dataset  
  - Explored state-wise and month-wise unemployment variations  
  - Visualized trends using bar charts and line graphs  
- **Outcome**: Revealed the sharp rise in unemployment during Covid-19 and highlighted regional impacts.

### 📧 Task 3: Email Spam Detection  
- **Objective**: Build a spam detector to classify emails as Spam or Not Spam using NLP & ML.  
- **Approach**:  
  - Preprocessed dataset (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal)  
  - Converted text into numerical features with **TF-IDF Vectorization**  
  - Trained ML models: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM  
  - Evaluated accuracy and confusion matrix  
- **Outcome**: Built an efficient spam detector that classifies emails with high accuracy.

### 💡 Task 4: Sales Prediction  
- **Objective**: Predict product sales based on advertising costs, audience, and platform.  
- **Approach**:  
  - Explored sales & advertising dataset  
  - Built regression models: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting  
  - Evaluated with **R² score** and **Mean Squared Error**  
- **Outcome**: Predicted sales trends to help businesses optimize advertising spend.
